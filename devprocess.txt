    django-admin startproject studybud
    django-admin startapp base

    configure base app on studybud settings.py (INSTALLED_APPS)
        - base.apps.BaseConfig
    setup templates folder on the root 
        - register on settings.py TEMPLATES [ BASE_DIR / 'templates']

    request - response process
        1, to main app urls.py, then this maps to specific app urls.py
        2, app urs.py to specific view
        3, app view to specific function
        4, app specific function to specific templates

    the main purpose of giving names to urls is whenever we use this url pattern in some "templates" and if we want to modify url name, we change it onlt inside urls.py because templates use name of the url no the actual url
    href="/room/{{room.id}} is href="{% url 'room' room.id %}"
